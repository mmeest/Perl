## About Perl
Perl's legacy is regular expression or 'regex'. Perl is still used on some servers to automate processes. The problem that perl has it had many variants. Initially it was made very flexible so you could do things with many different ways. So finally noone could read what the code was supposed to do. It was compact but not very readable code.
